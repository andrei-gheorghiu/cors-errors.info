By default, only the following response headers are exposed to JavaScript code for a CORS request:

*   Cache-Control
*   Content-Language
*   Content-Type
*   Expires
*   Last-Modified
*   Pragma

These are known as the _CORS-safelisted response headers_.

The specification was recently changed to add `Content-Length` to the list of CORS-safelisted response headers. This has been implemented in some browsers but at the time of writing it still isnâ€™t included in Firefox.

To expose other response headers you need to use `Access-Control-Expose-Headers`. See [developer.mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Expose-Headers) for more information.
